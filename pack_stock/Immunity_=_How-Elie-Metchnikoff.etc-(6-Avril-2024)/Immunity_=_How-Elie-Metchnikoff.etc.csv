Metchnikoff’s daring theory of immunity—that voracious cells he called phagocytes formed the first line of defense against invading bacteria—would eventually earn the scientist a Nobel Prize; shared with his archrival; as well as the unofficial m oniker “Father of Natural Immunity.” But first he had to win over skeptics; especially those who called his theory “an oriental fairy tale.” Using previously inaccessible archival materials; author Luba Vikhanski chronicles Metchnikoff’s remarkable life and discoveries in the first moder n biography of this hero of medicine. Metchnikoff was a towering figure in the scientific community of the early twentieth century; a tireless humanitarian who; while working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris; also strived to curb the spread of cholera; syphilis; and other deadly diseases. In his later years; he startled the world with controversial theories on longevity; launching a global craze for yogurt; and pioneered research into gut microbes and aging. Though Metchnikoff was largely forgotten for nearly a hundred years; Vikhanski documents a remarkable revival of interest in his ideas on immunity and on the gut flora in the science of the twenty-first century. ...more,e4f74c16de34d440,57.36,£,57.36,£,16,5 étoiles,https://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/e1/1e/e11e7e9514a123aee2415a1def85e638.jpg
